# Drumstick::RT Out of Tree Template Plugin (drumstick-rt-outoftree)

This project is a template/example for building a Drumstick::RT plugin, as an out-of-tree project.

Two plugins are included: `drumstick-rt-dummy-in` and `drumstick-rt-dummy-out`, that implement the `MIDIInput` and `MIDIOutput` interfaces respectively, but without functionality.

When installed, both plugins should be found and used by any Drumstick::RT based application, like [VMPK](https://vmpk.sourceforge.io) and [dmidiplayer](https://dmidiplayer.sourceforge.io).

Use this template to write your own plugins and enjoy!
